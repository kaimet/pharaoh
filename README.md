Rhythm game.

I guess I'll just let it sit here. Spend a lot of effort to develop it but can't really force myself to make enough effort to promote it. Tried to post it on reddit but reddit immediatly deleted my post and suspended my account. Nice. I guess it make sense since I have zero karma on reddit, but c'mon, how not too social dude like myself supposed to... Anyway... So that's about it. Still, that's one of the biggest of my projects, it was a good experience and I think it come out to be very nice, actually. I'm definately not dropping it, I'll be adding more songs and maybe some new features.
